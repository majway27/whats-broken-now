## Fun game ideas / Themes

- Mirage of satisfaction via career progression.
    - Dystopian corporate hellhole like beverance.
    - Rise in ranks, get bigger headaches when you have to manage down and up.
- Fork in story path
    - Struggle to climb the ladder and succeed earnestly.  On the backs of your team..
        - Protect the company from bad employees and bad customers.
            - Bad Employees
                - Adeptly wield the machinations of HR to drum someone out "legally".
            - Bad Customers
                - Play the game, machavellian politics to foist bad actors on onto someone else.
    - Carve a path of destruction as a clandestine, subversive industrial saboteur.  Leave a trail of lost revenue and bodies in your wake..
        - I just realized that this is the ultimate-boss-mode-screen since it looks like you are furiously hammering away at the CLI like a good little drone!  Just kidding don't play this at work.
